* One feature that my program has is the ability to move the virtual camera in any direction that the user wants by changing the Eye Position. 
   The user can zoom in on the scene by pressing W, can zoom out by pressing S, can move left by pressing A and can move right by pressing D. 
   Moreover, the whole scene can be rotated using the arrow keys.

* Another feature that the program has is to display the environment during morning or night time. This can be done by pressing M and N respectively.

* Another feature that the program has is that the large main building has a rotating door. 
  The door rotates by itself slowly, but the user can speed up or slow down the rotation speed of the door and even change its direction. 
  Also, there is a bird which moves forwards and backwards.

* Concluding the sign at the left of the scene is the real representation of the actual sign.
